- set up... something...so this can also be a usb keyboard? although I can just unplug the keyboard part and plug it into something else

- set up a boot/login screen. Might be 2 or 3 different ones to set; could make them identical or have a bit of extra text to indicate boot stage. Could use patlabor boot screen.

- set up Luxi Mono, although it might look bad at this screen's resolution
